# 🌩️ Cloud & DevOps Journey

Welcome to my Cloud & DevOps Journey — a living technical journal where I document what I’ve built, learned, broken, and deployed.

This repository is my **developer logbook**, tracking my progression from foundational concepts to building secure, production-ready infrastructure using:

- ⚙️ AWS (EC2, S3, Route 53, IAM, CloudFront, ECR)
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
- 📦 GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines)
- 📜 Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- 📈 Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
- 🛠️ Nginx, SSL, Networking, and IAM security practices

---

## Purpose

- Share real-world lessons learned while deploying fullstack cloud-native projects.
- Provide step-by-step infrastructure breakdowns (with diagrams and screenshots).
- Track how each project evolved from local dev to cloud deployment.
- Show recruiters and collaborators my ability to think in systems and execute.

## Why This Matters

I believe in **learning by doing** — and this repo captures that.  
Every commit, config file, and write-up is a reflection of my deep dive into Cloud and DevOps engineering.
